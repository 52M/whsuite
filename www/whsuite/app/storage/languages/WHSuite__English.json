It's not stored anywhere at all, so if you lose it, you lose anything encrypted with it. In addition, automated payments via cron will no longer work, as the passphrase will need to be entered manually to decrypt the payment details.<\/p>\n\n<p>We highly recommend using a passphrase, and accept no responsibility for the security or storage of your customers data. If you choose not to use a passphrase, you should consider using a 3rd party provider for storing your credit card details.<\/p>"
